# DiarizationGroundTruthTool

Manual diarization help
______________________________________________
For generating ground truth for speech diarization jobs ... or maybe also for subbing idk

## How to use
1) Press run. Use the 3 seconds of lead time given to sync the audio file closely as possible.

2) Use number keys (both the ones above the keyboard and numpad are fine) to indicate when which speaker talks.

3) Export as a txt file

4) Use a text editor to modify the file for use. e.g. replacing the default "Speaker 1" "Speaker 2", etc, replacing the default time span syntax, adding subtitle text, etc.

## TODO:

TODO: have the audio run inside the program.

Future of the work: I will not be developing the tool further after it's done. Feel free to fork it if you really really want to do something with it.
